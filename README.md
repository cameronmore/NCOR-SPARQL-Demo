This repository contains material that introduces some basic features of SPARQL, a query language for RDF.

The `Graphs/` directory contains the material and is broken into three levels of complexity. `1` intorduces some basic notions of traversing graphs and SPARQL operators like `SELECT`, `ASK`, `CONSTRUCT`.

The walk through uses RDFLib to parse and query the graphs.
