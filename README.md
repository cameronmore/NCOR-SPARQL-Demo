# NCOR SPARQL Walkthrough

This repository contains material that introduces some basic features of SPARQL, a query language for RDF.

The `Graphs/` directory contains the material and is broken into three levels of complexity. `1` intorduces some basic notions of traversing graphs and SPARQL operators like `SELECT`, `ASK`, `CONSTRUCT`.

The walk through uses RDFLib to parse and query the graphs.

If you'd like to try out this tutorial without using Python/RDFLib, you can paste each graph (in each numbered directory) and SPARQL query into the SPARQL Playground [here](https://atomgraph.github.io/SPARQL-Playground/).
